# thSearch 

### ðŸ‘‰NEW!!!

Multithreaded content search of files in specified folders. 

### Why?

I have a lot of text documents on my computer in various places (notes, bookmarks, pds, docxs, etc). I wanted *one* **blazing fast** âš¡ CLI command that would search just the locations and extensions I specify. thSearch uses a producer consumer multithreaded approach where a single producer thread finds candidate files and passes these off to "consumer" threads which do the content searching. It will automatically use an ideal number of threads.

### Usage

Create a file called thsearch.txt in the same folder as thsearch.exe. In this file, on separate lines, use + to include paths, - to exclude, and > to specify the extensions you want.

#### .\thsearch.txt 

```
+C:\Folder To\Include
-E:\Exclude\me\please
>.txt
>.md
>.pdf
>.docx
```

Then run 

```powershell
thsearch.exe <search term>
```

### Perfomance

Starting from the top and going line by line, the program will stop searching a file the moment it finds a match. So the deeper the term is in the file, the longer the time spent. 

I created ~30 gb of random words total across 10,000 files, nested three levels deep in 1,000 folders. The program thrashed my SSD, reading > 1.5 gb/s, and returned in seconds. Pretty cool

### Platform

Windows.

Soon: Linux (for now need to build it on linux manually)
